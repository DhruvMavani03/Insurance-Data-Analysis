### 1. PRISM Insurance Analytics Dashboard
  A comprehensive and interactive Power BI dashboard for PRISM INSURANCE PVT. LTD., offering a visual and analytical exploration of core insurance data relating to   policies, claims, customer demographics, and business operations.

### 2. Project Overview
  The PRISM Insurance Analytics Dashboard empowers business users, management, and analysts to interactively monitor key performance metrics, policy distribution,    claim settlement statuses, and extract actionable insights from insurance business operations. The dashboard is suited for stakeholders seeking clear visibility    into operational patterns and performance drivers across the insurance value chain.

### 3. Tech Stack
  • **MS SQL Server**: Data storage, cleaning (including duplicate removal), and preprocessing.<br>
  • **Power BI Desktop**: Dashboard development and data modeling.<br>
  • **Power Query**: Data transformation for quality and consistency.<br>
  • **Power BI Service**: Cloud report publishing and sharing.<br>
  • **Dataset**: CSV from course resources ("InsuranceData.csv").<br>

### 4. Data Source and Preparation
  The dataset contains anonymized insurance operations data with fields such as PolicyNumber, CustomerID, Gender, Age, PolicyType, PremiumAmount, CoverageAmount,     ClaimNumber, ClaimStatus, and more.

  Data was imported into MS SQL Server for cleaning (including removal of duplicates) prior to loading into Power BI, ensuring high data integrity for accurate       reporting.

  Cleaned data was visualized directly in Power BI via the SQL Server connector.

### 5. Key Features and Insights
